The Oddity-Market is an application offers an online platform for people to share or sell their collections or creative works. It is a system combined Amazon’s sales function and eBay’s auction function. Although it is much like eBay, our application is targeted only on to artistic works such as painting or photograph, facilitate user. Compare to eBay, our application differentiates in its targeted audience; the application is a specialized platform for artistic merchandise, providing users direct access to purchase artwork. Our team firmly believed that auctions are not only for the upper class, but it should be an affordable activity for people. Even though most auction focus on the rich’s, we have decided to target on anyone who appreciates arts. Also, Oddity market provides a friendly way for designers and collectors to communicate and share their artworks and it is a sales platform for users to purchase their favorite artworks. Our product is suitable for people seeking artworks and individuals desire audiences to appreciate their work. The goal is to help local original designers to display their works in a worldwide market and help collectors to find suitable artworks. Furthermore, we wish to give everyone a convenient way to meditate through arts, to escape from this busy world and relax.
