# Name of project: Oddity-market
 
The Oddity-Market is an application offers an online platform for people to share or sell their collections and creative works. It is a system combined with Amazon’s sales function and eBay’s auction function. Our application targets on artistic works such as painting or photograph. The application is a specialized platform for artistic merchandise, providing users with direct access to purchase artwork. Our team firmly believed that auctions are not only for the upper class, but it should be an affordable activity for people. Oddity market also provides a friendly way for designers and collectors to communicate and share their artworks. Our product is suitable for people seeking artworks and individuals desire audiences to appreciate their work. The goal is to help local original designers to display their works in a worldwide market and help collectors to find suitable artworks. Furthermore, we wish to give everyone a convenient way to meditate through arts, to escape from this busy world and relax.
